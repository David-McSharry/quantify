Group related markets under topic headings. For each topic:
1. A bold heading for the topic
2. An *italic quote excerpted verbatim from the article* that relates to this topic — this will be highlighted on the page
3. Bullet points for each relevant market

Format:

**Topic Heading** *"verbatim quote from the article text"*
- [Market Title](url) — Platform, N% — short justification
- [Multi-choice Market Title](url) — Platform — Option A N%, Option B N%, Option C N%

Try to give prediction market context to as many claims, speculations, and assertions in the article as possible. In a perfect world, every notable claim would have a relevant market linked to it. Scan the full article for quotable moments — the more quotes you highlight, the more useful the overlay becomes. The sidebar is scrollable so don't hold back.

Quotes must be exact excerpts from the article — they get highlighted on the page.

Avoid redundant markets. Don't list multiple markets that ask essentially the same question with slightly different dates. For example, this is bad:

- Will Iran strike a Gulf State on March 1? — Polymarket, 99%
- Will Iran strike a Gulf State on March 2? — Polymarket, 94%
- Will Iran strike a Gulf State on March 3? — Polymarket, 83%
- Will Iran strike a Gulf State on March 4? — Polymarket, 66%
- Will Iran strike a Gulf State on March 5? — Polymarket, 56%

Instead, pick the single most informative market from a cluster of similar ones (usually the one with the most interesting probability or the most relevant timeframe). Use the freed-up space for markets covering different angles of the story.

At the end, if you found markets that are broadly relevant to the article's topic but don't fit neatly under any specific quote, include them in a final section:

**Other Relevant Context**
- [Market Title](url) — Platform, N% — short justification
