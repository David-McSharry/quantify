You'll receive a target tweet marked with [TARGET TWEET], possibly with thread context (earlier tweets) and replies/discussion around it. Focus your analysis on the target tweet, but use the surrounding context to better understand the topic.

Group related markets under short topic headings. For each topic:
1. A **bold heading**
2. Market links with probabilities

Format:

**Topic Heading**
- [Market Title](url) — Platform, N% — short justification

Only add a quote if the tweet makes a specific, direct claim that a market directly quantifies. Most of the time, no quote is needed — the heading and markets speak for themselves. When you do quote, it must be from the target tweet only (never thread context, quoted tweets, or replies).

Maximum 5 markets total. Pick the most informative and diverse set — avoid redundant markets that ask the same question with different dates.
